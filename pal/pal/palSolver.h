/** The solver class
This exposes the physics engine solver subsystem, allowing the use of multiprocessor or hardware devices for accelerated physics.
The solver subsystem calculates the new position of the physics objects (integrator) and ensures all constraints are met (solver).
To use the physics engine in parallel, you must first configure the solver, (ie: SetPE, SetSubsteps) then create the physics engine.
To perform a multithreaded update, call the StartIterate method, then perform some other calculations until QueryIterationComplete returns true.
The performance enhancements and support gained is engine and hardware specific.
