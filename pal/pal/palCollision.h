/** The contact point

Consult the engine-specific documentation for more information.

/** The ray hit information.
The ray hit contains the information from the result of a ray casting operation.
This includes the body and geometry that terminated the raycast, as well as the position and normal of the hit location, and the distance from the origin of the initial ray cast operation.
Each engine may not support the full set of raycast information, so each variable should be checked for validity.
This can be done via the m_bHit, m_bHitPosition, and m_bHitNormal flags.
Example:
<pre>
palRayHit *prh;
if (prh->m_bHit)
	prh->m_vHitPosition.x //do a calculation
</pre>
Raycasting allows the implementation of AI functionality and the simulation of distance sensors (eg: PSD or Sonar)

/** The collision detection subsystem.
The collision detection sub system is the portion of the main physics engine responsible for determining whether and where objects are colliding.
It enables querying the geometry of the world, for example ray casting.
If you wish PAL to keep track of collision that occur you must call the 'Notify' functions for each body.
Colliding objects can be set to be in different collision groups to allow non-interacting collisions.
Not all engines support a seperate collision detection query system, so collision support for a physics engine must be tested before use.
Example:
<pre>
	palPhysics*pp = PF->GetActivePhysics();
	palCollisionDetection *pcd = dynamic_cast<palCollisionDetection *>(pp);
	if (!pcd)
		//error.
</pre>
