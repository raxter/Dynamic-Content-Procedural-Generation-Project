Physics Abstraction Layer (PAL)
-------------------------------

CMake (>=2.6.2) is required to build PAL ( http://www.cmake.org ). If you are new to CMake, please prefer using th GUI version, which is a bit more accessible to newcomers.

Run CMake and fill appropriate options and paths you find in the CMake cache, and configure until every variable has been set (Options generally have a description when not trivial).
When done, generate makefiles/project files and build accordingly.

Notes about finding dependencies:
- Some engines have a special variable used when finding them. You may change their value the very first time you encounter them (For instance ODE_DOUBLE_PRECISION, or BULLET_SINGLE_THREADED).
- You can add paths to PAL_ADDITIONAL_SEARCH_PATHS variable. This may help the finders modules to locate your dependencies.
- The script looks in "common" subdirs of PAL_ADDITIONAL_SEARCH_PATHS, such as "bullet", but not necessarily "bullet-2.71" or "bullet-2.73". However, you can directly set a path to your engine in PAL_ADDITIONAL_SEARCH_PATHS.
- Scripts will look for "*_DIR" and "*_PATH" environment variables (such as "BULLET_DIR" and "BULLET_PATH") to find dependencies.
- If you want the finders to restart their job about a given variable without clearing the whole cache, just set the variable to "NOTFOUND" and configure again.
- If a dependency is not found or not completely found (for instance if you put it in a custom directory), you should enter manually the paths:
	- *_INCLUD_DIR (For instance ODE_INCLUD_DIR) points to the include directory, as you would set it in your compiler (/parent/mylib/include for instance).
	- *_LIBRARY and *_LIBRARY_DEBUG point to the ".lib", ".so" or ".a" used by the linker, respectively for releases (= all but debug) and debug configurations. If *_LIBRARY_DEBUG is not found, then the scripts will use the release library in debug configuration.
	- *_LIBRARY_MODULE and *_LIBRARY_MODULE_DEBUG are purely optional and point to ".dll" (For Windows only). It is used only for automatic module copy. You may have to copy the modules to the right location or set your PATH accordingly if not set.

If you experience an undesirable behavior, try to:
1. Clear your CMake cache
2. Rebuild the whole project
3. Put all engines DLL/so in the PATH (or in the working directory)
This saves time to everyone!
