The premake files are now deprecated. 
If you wish to use them copy them back to the PAL root directory.

Compile

Under Windows, run the "configure.exe" gui, and follow the instructions.

For other systems, for example Linux or Mac OS-X:

Download/build a copy of premake for your environment:
http://premake.sourceforge.net/download

Edit the premake_generic.lua file and set the variable "lloc" to the path where all your packages are installed. 

Then type:
./premake --file premake_generic.lua --target gnu

Change to the build/gnu directory and type "make"

To save the output from a make file to a log use:
make libpal_NAME >success.log 2>errors.log
